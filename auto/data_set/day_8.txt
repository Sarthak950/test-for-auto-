Yes and that‚Äôs why doing a good research before investing is a good idea even though it‚Äôs not a guarantee. Let‚Äôs all be optimistic at this point
Its used its own Chain lotus Chain
As you know market is currently showing stability...
Oh what a coincidence, a friend of mine introduced me to this project and I have been researching on it for some time now. It really looks nice and promising too.
And may be in near future.all world will be accept crypto
How stable
Yeah imagine being able to build a Decentralized data network providing Connectivity and processing Micro payment for internet of things.
It is interesting thing that many countries still working on crypto
Were you able to find any information about the Project NODL?
Yah I think so bcz it's not on peak value those who invest in peak days
Yes. I learnt that the Nodle Network is a distributed network that provides delay-tolerant connectivity and services for IoT devices.
And what you think about new investors
Maybe or maybe not it Depends on next days of market that it will rise or not.
Yeah and for the fact that it already leverages on the already existing smartphone infrastructure to provide coverage and services. But i didn't really catch what services we could be providing Rosyz! I need more insight on that.
But there is no right predictions about next move of market
You‚Äôre so sexy! You‚Äôve made a fire in my pants. Find me here

Hello everyone, I am very happy to share the knowledge of virtual currency with you.
Yes that‚Äôs true but we still Have to try
As long as we keep each other in our hearts, our love will never be separated. "
That's definitely why I am putting all my research techniques to explore 
That‚Äôs a really good feature to explore. I got to understand that IoT Devices or Targets are any devices that can be connected 
If confused in anyway, you can check on the project official Twitter handle for more elaboration of details
But is NODL going to provide Devices that can be connected to the Network Contributors. Or we're using our mobile Devices?
I am doing just that Buddy. 
I love how enthusiastic and detailed you've been exploring the NODL to me. Shows how folks are buzzing about the project
ts going to be working on any device(s)             that can be connected to the Nodle Network through the resources available on the Contributors
So what Operating will the the NODL Protocol be launched on cos any Cash back System or ecosystem like most likely have it's chain or consensus.
I personally think this project would exceed its profit expectations really soon. 
Born to the sun, hello everyone
But it does collect my Current location right then. 
Then again what Currency will users be paid in
Coins were at it's peak...and we have enjoyed alot
When it will be at peak ,all investors will get too much profit

Ecaxtly bro we really enjoyed that day and get good profit from market
No doubt everyone enjoyed those days with great values
I hope my insignificant greetings can drive away the fatigue of your week! Have a great weekend

Network contributors would be rewarded in the NODL cash for their participation in the Nodle Network through a proof-of-connectivity algorithm
Do you think the NODL Protocol will get that wide acceptance?
Why not? the project is a promising one oweing to the fact that it‚Äôs team is an innovative one working hard and tirelessly to keep the project moving and progressive too
Have you been following the team seem you know them pretty well?
Yes I have and I know they would push the project to do well.
