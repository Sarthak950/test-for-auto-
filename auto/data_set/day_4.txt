We're seeing green market lately. I added xpress, iost, vet, pols when btc at $20k

I stake them. I stake vet on binance and xpress powered by the albt tech
Everytime you come with this
Binance is good platform for trading
From my side
You sounded like one first. Forgive my manners but I'm just citing the obvious.
Cryptorious is just kidding around i gues
Long term approach I guess. I still have some vet. What do you get on the two
Yeah but I needed to tell him the truth
Vet for around 8% and xpress for over 100% apy but this will gradually decrease as more people are staking.
Thats good i guess it lot
Keep pretending

Besides Gamefi with pictures, is there any other nft portfolio to invest in?

Fine, have you tried Alpha?
of course I am. I am getting impatient actually. might join the Nitro Legion ambassador program just to past the time. lol
I think that is good. Plus there are good perks too

Coca-Cola today announced it will gift exclusive
digital collectibles to existing Coca-Cola NFT holders.
Ohh great
collectibles to their NFT holders.
Virtue, the agency by Vice, developed the initial concept.

Once the collector shares their NFT with a frien
Oh! I haven't played any game in a long tim
What market place?
I knew him
two unique NFTs will be released on the platform
fans will be able to order physical CDs
vinyl records with unique cover artwork
hand-signed posters, available exclusively on LimeWire.
Close to Home‚Äô is Aitch‚Äôs debut album
Just the same way Kevin Smith launched is movie "killRoy was here" as NFT in the secret network
He is good artist
The collection has been completed
in collaboration with Soga World
One collection entails a physical copy of the new album
Quite interesting
And great to hear inovative projects
That was the first movie I know of that was launched as a NFT
Vinyl combined with a limited edition album cover
 the chance to win a variety of exclusive in-person benefits
The Limited Edition ‚ÄúClose To Home‚Äù album collection
consists of only 500 copies (250 CDs, 250 Vinyls),
The CD bundle is priced at $25
shipping included.
That's good rate
It's kind of good one
They are also leveraging all the benefits of Web3.
LimeWire interviewed Aitch on YouTube speaking about the NFT collection.
17 celebrities have been warned by ‚ÄòTruth in Advertising
the consumer watchdog group
It's new to me
and Tom Brady, among many others.
That created problem
That's big name
but they could potentially get involved if bad habits continue.
there has been no official involvement
from the FTC (Federal Trade Commission),
Are free to play games even rewarding?
of course. You will be rewarded when hold some NFTs too and if you're into a platform that provides real to it's users
NFTs are good to hold but I don't play free to earn games
I don't see them rewarding
I see. I love to play games. Are you holding some crypto?
I'm looking into NFTs a d privacy protocols
Do you mean tokens? I'm holding SCRT, ATOM, Metis, VRA Eth and a few others
Keep bpx as long as you can, apparently there is a good future ahead.
I'm looking to buy Anon V2 in the secret network
This Secret Network. I heard this everywhere
I got acquainted with bpx a few days ago and my next purchase is definitely bpx
No matter how far the future is, there are you and me on the way of growth
I'm looking to buy Anon V2 in the secret network
that's pretty cool to hear buddy
it was fine, I didn't check it a while now, because I'm focusing on NFTs that I currently doing research
I'm very excited to enter a bpx exchange and trade.
xcatly its a basic point in crypto world...Every good thing can take a huge time
Yeah we can sell them in million dollars if we are able to make a good nft.
If market will give loss for a complete year to investor then they will not invest again
They are depressed, disappointed from market behavior. But they can't treat market according to their wishes.
Exactly they have to run according to the market condition
I heard overall market showing down or..
Yeah btc is again going down and not showing any positive response
Yeah we were expecting that it will cross 50k but it is again down
Exactly it always go against our prediction
Yeah exactly, it is going against our expectations.
Exactly no one expecting it from Bitcoin
Exactly but no one is shower but will be next now
No, i have not checked yet.
Let's check it together
All are going down and showing negative behavior
Yeah almost whole market is down today , no improvement
If we see altcoins are at their bottom level mate
It's due to btc
Btc is down so if affect on mostly other coins. Mostly coins follow btc
Nope I'm not it's my favorite that's why everyone has its own thinking
Hi all, What do you think the market is like today?
Nowadays competition in market is very high
I think pump, BTC 50k soon
when the market recovers, I think there will be a lot of development platform
including BSCSstation
yes, a recovering market is a condition for projects to thrive, especially lauchpad platforms
i'm investing in BSCS, it's pretty cool, it's a multi ido platform
Soon it will have a lot of trending IDO projects
I know about BSCS, it's a great platform, already very popular. What IDOs are coming soon?
Nowadays competition in market is very high
IDO Antmos, this is a good project, I think it will develop, and bring profits to investors
the team is very strong, it is building methodically
BSCSstation's raise is pretty high, I'll participate in
If so, that's great, I remember I used to profit from IDO on BSCS with ROI x30 IDO price
Hopefully we'll see some good changes in the upcoming days 
Because situation is pathetic and are not suitable to business so everyone is afraid of this type of situation
Hopefully but situation keep on going against our predictions
Infact in nfts skills are required we can make our own nft and can sell them and this is how we can get a good profit
They are depressed, disappointed from market behavior. But they can't treat market according to their wishes.
