transportation when combined with the metaverse
Wow. This sounds futuristic has it launched
Yeah lots of them and that’s a good thing for holoride and their metaverse ecosystem.

Yeah lots of them and that’s a good thing for holoride and their metaverse ecosystem.
That's the future
Not yet. Their official launch is coming up this 
Yeah so many creative project out here bud
Yeah. You’ll get them on Twitter
The company introduced a new concept of metamobility
That would lead to mored adoption in the space
movement by combining virtual reality with the real world.
like flying cars, seem to fit in the virtual reality realm
I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to do that.
Exactly and creating thrilling fun filled BR entertainment that matches a car in motion
Hyundai has plans to bring those concepts into the physical world
what are you trying to say bud? i'm interested
Can’t wait to see that. They’re are also in Partnership with holoride.
There been a good conversation here about VR tech in crypto you could scroll up
Find it really interesting
Nice. What other partners they got
Hyundai into metaverse
Yeah it’s has good backing from top automobiles companies.
Would dmor on it thanks
Still down on my holdings so it's not fine atm. Btc keeps ranging and alts are doing same
Hahaha but it's already looking like it if you ask me bro
July was the market's best ever since the bears came... And I see it going well though slowly
Lol 😹 might be a other bull trap
We shouldn't see more dumps like we did at the begining of the year
You think so?
😂😂😂 please let's be more positive ... What if it isn't, may just be the bulls coming back.
Gosh I can hear my intuition laughing at me after saying this😂😂😂
So it can still drop back to 20k
Oh the Metaverse related project I guess... I've heard a little about it.
Well maybe just a few but not harsh ones🤔 or am I not thinking this right.
who's up into playing casino and lottery games?
Ahh I don't believe this market 😂
So you can tell me more about MetaSpets. Maybe about gameplay or anything ?
One more step toward crypto mass adoption
A few years ago JPMorgan was calling bitcoin a scam and warning everyone it was going to $0 ? Glad to see they wised up
Yes I know right
Now it's on their second preference 🤦😂
Strange how time changes 😂😂 especially in web3 industry
Crypto asset-backing will the next one. 😄😄
Hahaha time change everything
There's a plenty of value to be found in crypto. 🚀
Hoping new bull market comes soon enough to get our portfolios back up 🤞🤞
How is crypo is doing now?
/chart
Which one btc..?
/btc
I was saved by the staking pools of $TRADE 😆😆
are you in for longer time?
First, they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they join you. NFT is here to stay!
Mine is 30% low
Sol, ada, celo and polytrade
I m think to sell off by the end of the month
Don't sell just hold it as much as you can
For short term invest in shitcoins with high risk or hold Trade Ada  and Sol for long
Now 5th lendingpool is going to launch u can invest in that..
Polytrade is one of the safest project I personally saying
That's how these hypocrite VC's work they'll show something is worth nothing while stocking it to manipulate the market later on
That's how these hypocrite VC's work they'll show something is worth nothing while stocking it to manipulate the market later on
And web3 is all about breaking the monopoly and connecting people together
There you can get airdrop of trade token
That's great
New generation investors will increase this adoption rate of Bitcoin
At this time the market maker is still consolidating goods. when the goods are collected, it will only go up if not in 1-2 years, depending on the situation, long short if you want to make money.
It's my favourite timepass on discord 😂😂😂
And you can collect dank tokens
Ok how to play that 😅
Dank Memer is a very popular bot on Discord for image manipulation and playing with the currency system.
Team can't use their token until 3rd year
I'm not sure if I'm the only one who is interested in this
What is private sale price?
Somewhere I saw was $0.05 as team allocated
Projects give some tokens in discounted price in the return of investment from investors
Its like sale of coin or token to early investors
Why dоesn't anyоne talk abоut it
Rather they'd invest in coins and expect their money to get 2x and 10x
People are but they are not taking interest in that
It's new for everyone
Web3 have advanced
It's not new a long time ago web3 came
That’s right, BNB is a good choice. I am now increment every day, and at the same time I will use a portion of the profit to buy BNB
I don’t pay attention to any coins anymore, except BNB
Yes, in addition to keeping increment eth every day, I change most of the rest to BNB and sell a small part for my living expenses
This is the best
Takin deeeeep breathe. How u doin
Are you into P2E as well?
It's the next trend you know
Hahaha ! Every one going poetic😔
Trust me its fun and exciting you can take a close look at the enthralling story line and its tokenomics
😂 passing the weekend time, I gues
I'll write that down
Have you heard about AquaTank?AquaTank is offering life-time reward generation NFTs.Earn $162/day for the rest of your life.2% USDT reward on every single trade.
Of course I do
And in a time if bear market like this, short term investments isn't worth
Just started playing som
Zone of avoidance's APY is above 100
Which ones are you playing? How would you feel about staking and liquidity mining being directly integrated into a game?
I know they have staking
does it mean that they also produced some P2E games
Gami and on Roseon . Although blockchain holdings really my tuf. But I'm exploring
Yes it is , am excited i came across zone of avoidance tho
Yes
Staking on Pegasys Dex which runs on Syscoin blockchain.
The DEX name sounds aesthetic haha. Reminds me of Barbie
No someone was marketing their scammish trade
hoooooooooold BPX 👍
Why? ETH is doing good. ALBT partners QNT is doing good. Why BPX?
Is you're blind or naive buddy google the name
I think news of the Ethereum merge fuel it
I would if it wasn't deleted lol
Definitely the ETH merge news that did that. Because we're still far from a bull market. Also, EWT may be fueled too because of their association
What's it bring to the table?
Why would it be deleted when its the next bigger utility token? I just advise people to be careful with Allianceblock
Apparently they speak about how EWT brings more transparency to crypto. Something similar to tha
Are you okay? I wasn't calling your project a scam, someone above you was shilling their trader, I responded to that
saw kucoin having an  event regarding ETH Merge right now, has anyone joined that?
A lot to look out for with the merge
Like? Haven't been keeping up. Hopefully less gas fees too
I'm about to ask if you're ok because you ought to speak in a way that will avoid misconception next time kid
hey dude, well the event is about ETH Merge. surely you have heard of that. the Gold Rush Event is now available
That's some good ones. No wonder the price did well
yes that is correct man! so you have joined
That's impressive
What's the new considering the fact it does involve the third party?
The golden opportunity to close the gap Is here
A lot of people are not comfortable with the gas fee
That’s great, we will be waiting
Well, like you said, it's just recovery
we should understand that tbe bull run doesn't start 5 mins after the bear market
And number of people who are interested in nfts projects now increse...
Yeah trend changes with time..
There's always something wonderful in life, there's always surprises Thanks for my project I got a good income again
Exactly... as newly investors who invested in October after their investment they facing l00s
Launched a potential project that promises to bring huge profits to investors, go to my BIO section to join this community
Bnb eth and btc these coins are on top... And have good prices
Yeah and some alt coins also starts showing some upwards change in their pieces
Bnb eth and btc these coins are on top... And have good prices
Like bringing privacy to public by default chains like Ethereum? Nice one
Now that's good news, let's just wait to see how the merge will aid the chain generally
I guess it is unless it's a new project...🤔 Or have you heard of it before
Listed on Binance, Huobi, MEXC, gate io, braken etc
I already shared the two I'm most bullish on which are XRD and RAIL, XRD is the token for Radix a Blockchain while RAIL is the token for Railgun a multichain privacy protocol 🙂
I do like Railgun though because of it's dope privacy utility for DeFi, I can use it as a shield on my transactions as I interact with my preferred DeFi platforms.
I just shared buddy,I don't want to type the message all over again to avoid spam
Let's keep our fingers crossed  man
That's not a bad idea at all, lots of earning opportunities, just gotta choose what works best for you
Not just that but also privacy swaps as you can enjoy that with their Railway wallet which is currently live on web
Aside the private swaps , the Railway wallet also aids shielded balance and you can store your crypto more securely
Yeah I'm already doing that, let's hope for the best for every project on Ethereum shall we
It's just sad the merge aint going to fix the issue of gas fees
The POS mechanism solves the problem of high gas fees. I saw that with a delegated proof-of-Stake mechanism deployed in secret network
Maybe the Ethereum 2.0 will be what we've all been waiting for... Just that we don't know how long the wait will be
Investing is not just an act, but a philosophical thin
Hmmm so you're saying users can expect lower gas right?


I think it’s can help reduce the gas lol I hope so though 😅
It’s was said to happen in September but no fixed date yet.
Hehehe maybe in the next 5 years we'll know where we're headed with that story.
Yeah, the low energy consumption of POS guarantees a low fee
The issue with gas on Ethereum is just something else I'll really appreciate if it did
Bro not even capping now... Simply q(whenever)🙂
Let’s see how it goes. Eth gas can be a pain in the ass sometimes.
The Ethereum tools completed the upgrade successfully
What more do you expect?
Lol. Well with time we’ll know. It’s one of those things I’m anticipating to see before eoy alongs side a few other things like holoride NFT VR tech official launch
Really when is that. I saw 6th or 16th of September can’t remember but I don’t think that’s the right ones.
NativeFinance, multi-chain financial hub
Web Swap is live
Swap + Wallet, exchange, bridge and play!
NativeFinance1
Let's hope for it buddy
There's so much expectations on Eth merge I hope it goes as planned. What's holoride? Sounds new though
Finger crossed on that
Yeah so much buzz on it. That some T.A thinks it can flip Btc 😅
Lol I don't see that happening. It can x2 eth most like but flip btc lol not possible
It’s an NFT VR gaming project built for an entertaining in-car rides for passengers in an automobile
Let’s see how it goes. It’s really helping ETH go show good strength .
Not just Hyundai. Audi and others like Mercedes’ and Porsche.


Sounds interesting how will that work though?
They released a game called “Hyundai Mobility Adventure


They released a game called “Hyundai Mobility Adventure


on the popular platform Roblox
I will definitely go to have look on tha
The VR tech would be integrated into the back seat of the car. That’s where the fun is done. It’s a ride to earn and ride for fun NFT Vr tech
it is more than just mere entertainment
Lots of big automobile industry here
They claim it is a glimpse into the potential future
hi buddies, Be sure to buy bpx
