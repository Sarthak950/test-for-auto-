One more step toward crypto mass adoption
A few years ago JPMorgan was calling bitcoin a scam and warning everyone it was going to $0 ? Glad to see they wised up
Yes I know right
Now it's on their second preference 🤦😂
Strange how time changes 😂😂 especially in web3 industry
Crypto asset-backing will the next one. 😄😄
Hahaha time change everything
There's a plenty of value to be found in crypto. 🚀
Hoping new bull market comes soon enough to get our portfolios back up 🤞🤞
How is crypo is doing now?
/chart
Which one btc..?
/btc
I was saved by the staking pools of $TRADE 😆😆
are you in for longer time?
First, they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they join you. NFT is here to stay!
Mine is 30% low
Sol, ada, celo and polytrade
I m think to sell off by the end of the month
Don't sell just hold it as much as you can
For short term invest in shitcoins with high risk or hold Trade Ada  and Sol for long
Now 5th lendingpool is going to launch u can invest in that..
Polytrade is one of the safest project I personally saying
That's how these hypocrite VC's work they'll show something is worth nothing while stocking it to manipulate the market later on
That's how these hypocrite VC's work they'll show something is worth nothing while stocking it to manipulate the market later on
And web3 is all about breaking the monopoly and connecting people together
There you can get airdrop of trade token
That's great
New generation investors will increase this adoption rate of Bitcoin
At this time the market maker is still consolidating goods. when the goods are collected, it will only go up if not in 1-2 years, depending on the situation, long short if you want to make money.
It's my favourite timepass on discord 😂😂😂
And you can collect dank tokens
Ok how to play that 😅
Dank Memer is a very popular bot on Discord for image manipulation and playing with the currency system.
Team can't use their token until 3rd year
I'm not sure if I'm the only one who is interested in this
What is private sale price?
Somewhere I saw was $0.05 as team allocated
Projects give some tokens in discounted price in the return of investment from investors
Its like sale of coin or token to early investors
Why dоesn't anyоne talk abоut it
Rather they'd invest in coins and expect their money to get 2x and 10x
People are but they are not taking interest in that
It's new for everyone
Web3 have advanced
It's not new a long time ago web3 came
That’s right, BNB is a good choice. I am now increment every day, and at the same time I will use a portion of the profit to buy BNB
I don’t pay attention to any coins anymore, except BNB
Yes, in addition to keeping increment eth every day, I change most of the rest to BNB and sell a small part for my living expenses
This is the best
Guys, what abbpx is a redifining trust,value, and ownership👌👌
Just come across Tamadoge on Reddit, learnt they’re presale on presale. But Tamadoge a meme coin and what are the features?

Ohh i see
cool, that's nice to hear buddy, anyway how about your research on some projects?
Then what project are you sticking in?
Can I just tell you to check up on Syscoin blockchain?
It's a solid project with good use case
Yeah sure, would love to explore that one, since I've been surrounded by p2es and metaverse lately
really? have you heard that metaverse of the island? well, basically they call it metaisland
 
 Nice,in addition they very high in cutting edge technology. Very innovative project.
 The metaverse to kes these days. Big cooperations moving in. From Toyota to Gucci and Netflix
and ohh metaisland mate is a metaverse game where you need to survive in the island to earn rewards including ISL tokens
Let me guess..they build and party on islands?😁
Really? those are huge sponsorship dude
what project are you referring mate?
Yeah..most open virtual shops and offices on the metaverse
Yeah..most open virtual shops and offices on the metaverse
it's more than that mate, anything that can you expect would happen if you join their beta test net this coming sept
Syscoin blockchain bro. A project that's soaked in high end technology.
Anything ? Even space travel😂
are they live mate? where I can browse their site?
If you wish too mate haha, rest assured you'll going to enjoy it
They have been around since 2014. Syscoin is on more than 30 exchanges. Binance , kucoin and all
Which altocoin are we taking to the moon for weekend
I don't have a spaceship but I am pretty sure $ZOA would take me to the moon😀
Why ZOA though? Never even heard of it
Hahaha! Only memes moon that fast and crash even faster but if you looking for a sure reliable project you can LP farm try SYS.
Regarding this we could use one of my best spaceships Raymond to take a tour through the moon
if you are familiar with crypto trends you will know that P2E is the next trend and ZoA is like the most advanced and standard P2E I have seen so far
Hahaha...I love the way you put it. What's it about?
Yes mate and I would be baging more this weekend..
Well you can also take a tour through zone of avoidance and its utility tokens $ZoA
But firstly, what role will this spaceship play in this game Zone of Avoidance?
If there is $bullshi then $ZOA is very fitting
It's the hottest P2E token right now so anticipate 💯
It will be the transport system for which you tour the Zone Of avoidance.
That's very good. I'm really planning on staking $ZOA soonest. I want to maximize this staking APR of about 110%
Well it seems we are going on mission, that's where the spaceship comes in. Anyways zone of avoidance is an auto battler where you get to defeat your opponents and earn tokens
Exactly mate 100% is no joke..
Yes I do know P2e is a big industry.  GameFi is booming
I’ve never been a part of something like a Drip style protocol, apparently they can do pretty well? I come from the land of Ponzi scheme “nodes”
Didn’t really have plans to stake my tokens but I think I might wit the maximizer
ah you’re one of the strong ones. the forks dont do well but the OGs do.
GM everyone! How's everyone doing today
Hello admin,  This is Rakibul, Token listing Manager of Bitmart exchange,  who is the concern person for discussing about listing?
hey guys, do I need to use a refferal link to deposite in maximizer?
I rather get answer here thanks
Bought 1.5 BNB of tokens yesterday, at around $1.19.. happy to see the token continues to see steady growth, day by day
It not about cheap it’s about how big there are and how they can push us
I thought as much, I mean nothing is free anywhere
Scammers are always finding ways.
Yeah, those guys thinks we are newbies
They may not believe on that but time will come, life will punish them.
Yeah. One was asking for 20 dolls to get 40 dolls. I told him he should send the 40 dolls first. 😂
Karma will definitely catch up with them
Yeah but they don't want to follow the hard way
I'm not familiar with railgun.
I know how monero, dash and SCRT operate.
Anyway, life will punish them soon. I'll just do what is safe and legit to me. I stake on Freeway and I like the daily rewards I get.
It seems the privacy sector is really advancing. So with payment system, I like that of xpress in this regard
It's more than a staking platform. It's an asset management platform bridging cefi and defi.
Have they started burning?
Like we can trade on nfts privately?
No but they have stated and it may likely start anytime. I expect their debit card to roll out soon.
On every of their staking program
Yeah, as what I said above and they already released their report performance on their source of revenue as requested by the members.
Yeah, the NFT integration on the platform is in progress though
Yeah, because you don't need to hold their token before you can use this platform
Ofcourse, you can choose to maintain public balance if you want as well
Okay, which assets do you have staked there and what's the return like?
I see, in that way, people are comfortable enough
I read the article about metaverse , it was an amazing
Yeah , as usual organic growth , I just don't want any fake pump by Elon or someone like him!
STEPN has been integrated with Binance Smart chain recently!
since i think it will hibernate for a while
So you can tell me more about MetaSpets. Maybe about gameplay or anything ?
